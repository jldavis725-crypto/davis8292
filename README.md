I am submitting the draft mobile website for Brooks Town Home Furnishings. This draft includes three pages (Home, Products, and Contact) designed from the wireframes previously submitted.
Home Page: Features a banner, welcome text, and featured product placeholders.
Products Page: Organized by categories (Living Room, Bedroom), with placeholders for product images and descriptions.
Contact Page: Includes a contact form (name, email, message), store address, phone, and email placeholders.
The design uses a mobile-first approach with responsive layout (CSS grid/flexbox), placeholder images, and consistent navigation. This submission represents the basic structure of the site, with filler text and images where final content will be added later.
ðŸ”¹ Current Status
3 working pages with navigation links.
Mobile-friendly layout.
Basic styling and structure complete.
ðŸ”¹ Planned Updates
Add additional pages (Specials, Gallery, About Us).
Improve the navigation with a hamburger menu for smaller devices.
Replace filler content with real product photos, promotions, and store details.
