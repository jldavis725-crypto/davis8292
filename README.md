Brooks Town Home Furnishings Mobile Draft Website
I am submitting the draft mobile website for Brooks Town Home Furnishings. This draft includes three pages (Home, Products, and Contact) designed from the wireframes previously submitted.
Home Page: Features a banner, welcome text, and featured product placeholders.
Products Page: Organized by categories (Living Room, Bedroom), with placeholders for product images and descriptions.

The design uses a mobile-first approach with responsive layout (CSS grid/flexbox), placeholder images, and consistent navigation. This submission represents the basic structure of the site, with filler text and images where final content will be added later.

Mobile-friendly layout.
Basic styling and structure complete.
üîπ Planned Updates
Add additional pages (Specials, Gallery, About Us).
